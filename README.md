## What is a Repeater Field in WordPress?

WPForms repeater fields enable users to add multiple particular fields in a form by duplicating the existing fields. This allows users to submit multiple sets of data easily by clicking on the **“Add”** button option.

## Why you should build repeatable blocks to your forms?

There are cases when you can’t be sure how many fields the user will need in the form. Thus, by giving users the ability to add fields to your forms, you can make the form more adaptable to different use cases.

*For example, they want to add more fields to leave comments or mention designs, colors, sizes…related to their uniform order*. By doing so, you can ensure that you get all the information you need to complete an order successfully.

You should notice that the flexibility and functionality of the form on your website can be improved with the **WPForms Repeater Field** to provide a delightful user experience. Since users are given the ability to add the necessary fields by themselves, it assists in the creation of clear and engaging forms without lacking any essential details from users.

With that said, let’s step through our tutorial on how to build a repeater field in WPForm.

## How to Create a WPForm with Repeatable Fields?
### Step 1: Install and Activate Plugin 

In this tutorial, we are using [WPForms Repeater Fields by Rednumber Developer](https://1.envato.market/rQz7P5) to build a repeater field in our forms.

After downloading the plugin, it’ll be saved as ZIP files on your device.

Installing WPForms is easy and similar to installing any other WordPress plugin. Now, go back to the WordPress dashboard and open **Plugins >> Add New -  Upload Plugin** and choose the ZIP files, then install and activate it.

### Step 2: Construct a WPForm with Repeating Sections

To create a new form, click on WPForms from the left sidebar of the WordPress dashboard. 

Now click on the **Add a New Form** button

You will see the window, let’s start with a New Blank Form.
Click **Blank Form**, a new page appears on your screen that looks something like given below. It’s the interface of WPForms.

On the left are all the form fields available for use and their field options. On the right is where you build the form by adding rows and placing fields in them. All you have to do is drag the fields from the left into the row on the right.

Let’s create a **Working History** form where we will let applicants add fields for including their rich experience in the past. 

First, we add **Name Fields** and a Single Line Text for **Position Fields.**

Click on the **Field Options.** You can customize the label, format, and size... You can also make any field required so that a user can not submit the form unless filling up that required field.

Click on the **Start Repeater** from the **Standard Fields** tab to add it to your form.
